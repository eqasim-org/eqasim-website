**The website has recently been updated.** Some more information about the packaged MATSim dsitribution of of *eqasim* will be available here soon, including information on the two major tweaks compared to the standard configuration of MATSim:

- The use of *discrete choice models* for decision-making instead of the co-evolutionary scoring approach.
- The use of *volume delay function* traffic dynamcis instead of the detailed queue dynamics implemented in standard MATSim.

For the time being, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/eqasim-org/ile-de-france">eqasim-java repository</a> which contains all the relevant code and some documentation.
