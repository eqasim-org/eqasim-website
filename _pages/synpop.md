**The website has recently been updated.** Some more information about the synthetic population part of *eqasim* will be available here soon. For the time being, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/eqasim-org/ile-de-france">repository</a> of our case for **France**, which is our reference implementation, and its respective <a href="https://eqasim-org.github.io/ile-de-france/">documentation</a>.
